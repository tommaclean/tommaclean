## Hi, I'm Tom MacLean 

> I started my career in audio engineering. In 2019 I decided I wanted to make a career change and found coding exciting and challenging. After attending Flatiron School and seeing my final fullstack application deployed, I've been building upon what I learned to grow while searching for my first job in tech.
